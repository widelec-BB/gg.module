# gg.module
Module for KwaKwa adding GG network (former Gadu-Gadu) support.

For compilation you need to have installed [libvstring](https://github.com/widelec-BB/libvstring).

This module contains gglib which is a statically linked library for communication with GG network.
Full documentation for gglib is available in source code and may be extracted with Robodoc.
Documentation extracted to HTML format can be also [accessed via GitHub pages](https://widelec-bb.github.io/gg.module/).
Documentation is written in polish as this library was a part of my school project. ;-)
